# Logic Gates
This document contains designs for different logic gates made using npn
transistors in tinkercad and the circuts built using real components. The builds
containing real components do not have lights signifying which inputs are on,
and have loose wires instead of switches or buttons.


# Not Gate
## Overview
A not gate is a simple circut that inverts the signal of the input.  

In the physical build, the input is actually wired into both inputs of a Nor gate.

# And Gate
## Overview
An And gate is a logic gate that only turns on if both of the inputs are on.  

The load is on the other side for the physical build.

# SR Latch Gate
## Overview
An SR latch is a latch which can store one bit of volatile memory. It has two
input, one to set the bit and one to reset the bit. When the set input is on,
the bit becomes a one. When the reset input is on, the bit becomes a zero.  

The capacitors should have at least 10 mF of capacitance.
